## About Me
Hello! I'm [Emir AKSU](), and here's a little about me.

### Projects
- **Baraj24:**  Developed an iOS application that displays the current and historical daily water levels of dams in Turkey. In this project, I used the MVC architecture and managed data with Firebase. I created the user interface using Programmatic UI methods. Additionally, I integrated the Charts library to visualize the data with graphs and organized the information using Table View. For managing notifications, I used One Signal Notifications.

- **Noteor:** Noteor is a comprehensive application that includes features like a To-Do list, calendar, notifications, voice-to-text input, and encryption. Developed under the MVC architecture, I used Firebase as the database for this project and combined Custom UI with Programmatic UI techniques to create a user-friendly interface. I integrated AVFoundation to enable voice-to-text input for users and used Table View and Collection View to organize content. During development, I adopted a clean and modular coding approach and integrated encryption techniques to ensure the security of user data. I consistently followed the evolving iOS technologies to ensure the project adhered to best practices.
